This repository contains the solutions and implementations for the lab experiments conducted in the EE324 course, Control Systems Laboratory,
Control Systems Laboratory, offered at IIT Bombay. The course provides hands-on experience in applying control theory concepts to real-world systems.

üìÅ Repository Structure
Lab1/: PID control implementation for a rotating motor.

Lab2/: Line follower robot using PID control.

Lab3/: Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) control for an inverted pendulum.

Lab4/: Noise cancellation in headphones using adaptive filtering.
